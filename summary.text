2025-09-23 09:05 EDT – Reviewed SLURM job 1466302 (a1122u11n01), parsed BindCraft outputs for convergence, logged metrics to metrics/a1122u11n01_progress.csv, and reported that the run is unlikely to finish within the 12 h limit due to repeated MPNN filter rejections.
2025-09-23 19:40 EDT – Verified 1MKC chain A numbering with Bio.PDB (python inline script) and corrected epitope definitions in data/epitopes/lrp1_patch.json plus config.{yml,yaml} to use residues 81,86,87,89,99,102 and updated metadata.
2025-09-23 19:47 EDT – Submitted sbatch job 1474841 via slurm_run_pipeline.sbatch (03_define_epitope.py → 04_run_bindcraft.py → 05_convert_to_nanobody.py → 06_analyze_results.py; env bindcraft-af3) using data/structures/1mkc.pdb with updated epitope; queue status PD (ReqNodeNotAvail, maintenance).
2025-09-23 23:45 EDT – Submitted sbatch job 1476101 to gpu_devel (RTX 5000 Ada) via slurm_run_pipeline_gpu_devel.sbatch; pipeline: 03_define_epitope.py → 04_run_bindcraft.py → 05_convert_to_nanobody.py → 06_analyze_results.py → collect_metrics.py; pending with reason None.
2025-09-23 23:48 EDT – Attempted to extend gpu_devel job walltime to 20 h; sbatch rejected with QOSMaxWallDurationPerJobLimit, reverted script to 4 h and left job unsubmitted pending user direction.
2025-09-23 23:57 EDT – Resubmitted BindCraft pipeline to gpu_devel as job 1476141 (slurm_run_pipeline_gpu_devel.sbatch, 4 h walltime, bindcraft-af3 env) covering scripts 03_define_epitope.py → 06_analyze_results.py plus collect_metrics.py; job pending (None).
2025-09-24 00:13 EDT – Implemented dual LRP1+integrin epitope pipeline: added data/epitopes/mdk_dual_block_patch.json and footprint refs, refactored 03_define_epitope.py/04_run_bindcraft.py/05_convert_to_nanobody.py/06_analyze_results.py for campaign-aware paths, contact gating, and occlusion scoring; created config_lrp1_patch.* and updated collect_metrics.py plus README instructions for running legacy vs dual campaigns.
2025-09-24 13:09 EDT – Resumed BindCraft run 20250923-235758 with relaxed dual-block gating for analysis (no integrin contacts detected), regenerated design summaries/sequences, converted 6 nanobodies, ran 06_analyze_results.py diagnostics, and refreshed metrics/smoke_test_run.csv.
2025-09-24 13:53 EDT – Added AF3 validation helper (07_validate_with_af3.py) plus oc-af3 SLURM template, and confirmed residue mapping (Arg28→1MKC 89) with updated occlusion pipeline for Arg28/Ser127 checks.
2025-09-24 19:58 EDT – Cleared conda caches to recover space, installed PyYAML/Biopython into oc-af3, updated 07_validate_with_af3.py to emit uppercase chain IDs, and resubmitted AF3 validation via slurm_run_af3_validation.sbatch (job 1483459; seeds 1-4; LRP1_Human_MK-TRAP) writing outputs to results/dual_block/af3/af3nb_nb_MDK_human_l60_s927971_mpnn5.
