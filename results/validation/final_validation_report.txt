RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
----------------------------------------

1. Expression System:
   - Primary: E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET vector system
   - Alternative: Pichia pastoris for difficult-to-express candidates

2. Purification Strategy:
   - His-tag purification followed by size exclusion
   - Consider Protein A purification for Fc-fusion formats

3. Binding Validation:
   - SPR with immobilized MDK (focus on C-terminal domain)
   - Competition assay with LRP1 receptor fragments
   - Cell-based assays using LRP1-expressing cells

4. Specificity Testing:
   - Cross-reactivity with PTN (pleiotrophin)
   - Binding to other heparin-binding proteins
   - Species cross-reactivity (human, mouse, rat MDK)

5. Functional Assays:
   - MDK-LRP1 signaling inhibition
   - Cell migration/invasion assays
   - Downstream pathway analysis (AKT, ERK)
